            <h2>Safety First</h2>
            <img class="body" src="images/site/safety_image.jpg" alt="Motorcycle safety gear">
            <p>At MotoAdventure Club, your safety is our top priority. We believe that a great ride is a safe ride. Here
                are our key safety principles and requirements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Gear Up: All riders must wear full protective gear (see below.)</li>
                <li>Bike Check: Ensure your motorcycle is in good working condition before each ride. We'll conduct
                    brief pre-ride checks focusing on tires, brakes, lights, and fluid levels.</li>
                <li>Group Riding Etiquette: We'll review group riding guidelines before each outing, including hand
                    signals, staggered formation, and safe following distances</li>
                <li>Ride Your Own Ride: While we ride as a group, each rider is responsible for their own safety. Never
                    push beyond your comfort level or skill set.</li>
                <li>Zero Tolerance for Alcohol/Drugs: Any rider suspected of being under the influence will not be
                    allowed to participate.</li>
                <li>First Aid: Our ride leaders are trained in basic first aid and carry first aid kits.</li>
                <li>Emergency Contacts: We keep a list of emergency contacts for all members. Please ensure your
                    information is up to date.</li>
                <li>Weather Considerations: Rides may be postponed or cancelled in case of severe weather conditions.
                </li>
                <li>Insurance: All riders must have valid motorcycle insurance as required by law.</li>
                <li>Rider Skill Levels: We organize rides suitable for various skill levels. Always choose rides
                    appropriate for your experience.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We carry puncure patch and plug kits, as well as tubes for most popular tyre sizes. We also contract with
                Nationwide Motorcycle Recovery in the event of a situation arising such as a breakdown or a puncture
                that we cannot repair on the road.</p>
            <p>Remember, safety is a shared responsibility. By joining MotoAdventure Club, you agree to adhere to these
                safety guidelines and to ride responsibly at all times.</p>
