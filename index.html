        <h2>About the Club</h2>
        <p>Moto Adventure Club is a monthly subscription breakfast run club for motorcycling enthusiasts. For a monthly subscription of &#8364; 20 you are invited to join in a monthly breakfast run on the second Sunday of every month.</p>
        <p>Once a quarter we also organise a weekend away ride that includes a camp, barbeque and longer rides. During the summer months we also organise a week long getaway. These longer rides are on an adhoc basis and do not form part of the main subscription.</p>

        <p>Your subscription allows us to cover our administration fees, employ the guide and sweepers and provide one saftety support vehicle. We also make use of the subscription fees to pay an initial deposit at the restaurants, pubs or coffee shops we stop in at along the way so we can book tables ahead of time.</p>

        <h2>Safety</h2>
        <p>Your safety is of utmost importance, which is why we always have a backup vehicle join us with a first-aid trained driver and fully stocked with first aid and basic recovery equipment on board.</p>
        <p>We carry puncure patch and plug kits, as well as tubes for most popular tyre sizes. We also contract with Nationwide Motorcycle Recovery in the event of a situation arising such as a breakdown or a puncture that we cannot repair on the road.</p>
