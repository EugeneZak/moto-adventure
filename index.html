        <h2>Safety First</h2>
        <p>At MotoAdventure Club, your safety is our top priority. We believe that a great ride is a safe ride. Here are our key safety principles and requirements:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gear Up: All riders must wear full protective gear (see below.)</li>
            <li>Bike Check: Ensure your motorcycle is in good working condition before each ride. We'll conduct brief pre-ride checks focusing on tires, brakes, lights, and fluid levels.</li>
            <li>Group Riding Etiquette: We'll review group riding guidelines before each outing, including hand signals, staggered formation, and safe following distances</li>
            <li>Ride Your Own Ride: While we ride as a group, each rider is responsible for their own safety. Never push beyond your comfort level or skill set.</li>
            <li>Zero Tolerance for Alcohol/Drugs: Any rider suspected of being under the influence will not be allowed to participate.</li>
            <li>First Aid: Our ride leaders are trained in basic first aid and carry first aid kits.</li>
            <li>Emergency Contacts: We keep a list of emergency contacts for all members. Please ensure your information is up to date.</li>
            <li>Weather Considerations: Rides may be postponed or cancelled in case of severe weather conditions.</li>
            <li>Insurance: All riders must have valid motorcycle insurance as required by law.</li>
            <li>Rider Skill Levels: We organize rides suitable for various skill levels. Always choose rides appropriate for your experience.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We carry puncure patch and plug kits, as well as tubes for most popular tyre sizes. We also contract with Nationwide Motorcycle Recovery in the event of a situation arising such as a breakdown or a puncture that we cannot repair on the road.</p>
        <p>Remember, safety is a shared responsibility. By joining MotoAdventure Club, you agree to adhere to these safety guidelines and to ride responsibly at all times.</p>
