# Code Institute Project 1 - MotoAdventure Club

## About the Site

MotoAdventure Club is an imagined Dublin-based motorcycle breakfast run club for motorcyclists that wish to meet up once a month and go out for a ride together. Their website is a demonstration of a basic but responsive HTML and CSS site used as an informational homepage as well as a lead-generation tool where potential members can submit a registration form.
